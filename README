Minecraft Version Selector stores a list of minecraft.jar files and their
locations, and can copy these .jars into the system's minecraft gamefile path.

This lets you switch quickly and easily between multiple Minecraft versions,
whether they be from different updates or simply jars containing different mods.

The interface should be fairly self-explanatory, further instructions are in the
help menu of the program, under 'instructions'.

Self contained packages for Windows and Mac can be found in the download section
of the github page.

Dependancies:
    python 2.x (made with 2.7, should work with lower)
    pyside
